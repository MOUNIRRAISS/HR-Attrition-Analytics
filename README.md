#### Title  
HR Attrition Analysis 

#### Description

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition to help HR teams identify key drivers of employee turnover. Using an interactive dashboard, the project visualizes critical metrics such as attrition rates by department, age group, and job role, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights.

#### Tools Used 

- Python for data cleaning and visualisation
- Power BI for dashboard creation.

#### Data Source
The data used for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

### Python Data Cleaning and Visualization 

#### Step 1 Importing Necessary Packages

The first step in any data analysis project is to import the necessary packages or libraries. These libraries provide the functions and tools needed to manipulate the data, perform computations, and create visualizations. Below is the code I used to import the required packages for this project:

#### Step 3 Verifying the Dataset 

After importing the dataset, it's important to verify its structure and understand the types of data it contains. We can do this using the info() function in pandas, which provides details about the dataset, such as the number of entries, column names, data types, and the presence of missing values.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7709037-80c1-4d09-a208-b7440a32584a)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6027d574-48d0-4e16-92cc-1abb4a55460c)

This output indicates that the dataset contains ***1470*** entries with no null values across all columns, which ensures data completeness. Additionally, the data types for each column are appropriate, with int64 for numerical variables and object for categorical variables. This suggests that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, with no immediate need for data type corrections or null value handling.

#### Step 4 Checking for Duplicates 

In data analysis, it's crucial to check for duplicate entries, as they can skew your results. To ensure the integrity of the dataset, we use the duplicated() function to identify any duplicate rows.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23660a78-47e6-409c-bec7-cb44a708de89)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fec74f-d845-4ce8-93df-b5cb775d70b8)

This output  confirms that there are no duplicate rows in the dataset. This indicates that the data is unique and does not require any deduplication process, ensuring the integrity of the dataset for analysis.


##### "We have thoroughly verified the dataset, including checks for null values, duplicate rows, data types, unique identifiers, and potential inconsistencies. All aspects of the data are in good condition, with no issues requiring modification. The dataset is clean, complete, and ready for further analysis"

#### Step 5 Descriptive Statistics 

To better understand the dataset, I performed descriptive statistical analysis using the describe() function in pandas. This step provides a summary of the dataset's numerical columns, helping to identify key metrics like the mean, median, and standard deviation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc46e0c3-dc35-4107-b7e7-cc044e8f3046)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a405d7-f4be-4bc5-a1f4-b5db88ae84c2)

Descriptive statistics provide a comprehensive overview of a dataset's key characteristics, allowing us to understand its structure and tendencies.

we have :

- Mean: The average value, indicating the central point.
- Standard Deviation: The variability around the mean.
- Range (Min and Max): The span from the smallest to the largest value.
- Q1 : The First Quartile The value below which ***25%*** of the data falls.
- Q2 : The Second Quartile The middle value of the dataset when sorted. It divides the data into two equal halves.
- Q3 : The Third Quartile The value below which ***75%*** of the data falls.

#### Step 6 Distribution Of Age

#### Step 7 Attrition Analysis 

In this step, we analyze the Attrition column of the dataset to understand the distribution of employee attrition (whether employees left or stayed in the company).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd15924a-eebb-46ad-be2e-2f2ca186698b)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ade1ee2-ba2c-47b3-86f9-9ddd7b3c92bc)

##### Here's a visualization

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55d9c60f-1d57-4b45-9171-cb947589b59f)

**YES**: means left

**NO**: means stayed

The Attrition Count indicates that out of the total ***1470*** employees in the dataset, ***1233*** employees stayed with the company (marked as 'No'), while ***237*** employees left the company (marked as 'Yes').

The Attrition Percentage reveals that approximately ***83.88%*** of the employees stayed, while about ***16.12%*** of employees left the company. This provides a clear picture of the employee retention rate, indicating that a relatively small proportion of employees decided to leave. However, it‚Äôs essential to explore the reasons behind the attrition. By analyzing various factors and variables (such as age, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.), we can identify the key drivers of employee turnover and gain valuable insights into areas that may need attention to reduce attrition



#### Step 8 Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by gender

In this step, we analyze  Distribution of gender and the relationship between employee attrition and gender to determine if there are any gender-based patterns or differences in attrition rates.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46e84e99-0ba3-4107-b20a-134af06042a8)

##### output

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2b7bc27-fafd-4d5f-a4db-979702d75659)

#### The results provide a gender-specific analysis of attrition:

- Female Employees:

***85.20%*** of female employees stayed with the company, indicating a high retention rate among women.

Only ***14.80%*** of female employees left the company, reflecting a relatively low attrition rate.

- Male Employees:

***82.99%*** of male employees stayed with the company, which is slightly lower than the retention rate for female employees.

***17.01%*** of male employees left the company, indicating a higher attrition rate compared to females.

These results suggest that female employees tend to have a slightly higher retention rate than male employees in the company. The reason behind this difference could be explored further by analyzing factors such as job satisfaction, work environment, or other demographic and professional attributes. Understanding these dynamics can help the company address specific issues related to male attrition and improve overall employee retention

#### Step 9 Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by Department

in this step we will explore the distribution of employees across various departments and analyze the attrition (employee turnover) rate within each department

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c18d67-a1fb-4c65-a63e-a3f70b7ac13b)

#### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb9ad77-ef17-44f5-8e17-2b7a65488e78)

The data shows that while Research & Development has the lowest attrition rate, Sales and Human Resources exhibit relatively higher levels of employee turnover.

#### Step 10 Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by Marital Status 

In this step, we explore the marital status distribution of employees, calculating both the total number of employees in each marital status category and their corresponding percentages. Additionally, we analyze attrition rates based on marital status. By understanding the relationship between marital status and attrition, we can identify whether certain marital statuses correlate with higher or lower employee turnover. This information may help in making targeted interventions to improve retention across different employee groups.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f38a5c-885d-46f5-b5ee-00cd6fe2c55a)

#### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41d2edf7-82f2-444e-802a-d130e720443f)

The distribution of marital status among employees shows that the majority are married (45.78%), followed by single employees (31.97%) and divorced employees (22.24%). This suggests that marital status is relatively balanced, with a larger portion of the workforce being married. The next step would be to analyze how attrition correlates with these marital status categories to determine if employees in certain marital statuses are more likely to leave the company.

### Attrition by Marital status

##### Here's a visualization

#### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54aa07a8-9cb2-46ad-86c2-eba6466f282c)

This visualization shows the attrition distribution by marital status. Key insights from the charts:

1. ***Single Employees***: Among single employees, 25.5% have left the organization (attrition), while 74.5% have stayed. This is the highest attrition rate among the three groups.
2. ***Married Employees***: Only 12.5% of married employees have left the organization, with 87.5% staying. This indicates the lowest attrition rate.
3. ***Divorced Employees***: 10.1% of divorced employees have left, and 89.9% have stayed. This group also has a very low attrition rate, similar to married employees.¬µ

- Single employees seem to be more prone to attrition compared to married or divorced employees.
- Stability in employment appears higher among married and divorced groups. This trend could suggest that marital status influences employee retention.

#### Step 11 Attrition Analysis by Education Field

In this step, we analyze the distribution of employee attrition across different education fields.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af9e1770-d80d-4c39-a46c-2fc138caf0f1)

#### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1a997ad-4b71-4ae6-afa9-3e1cab188358)

 Human Resources and Technical Degree experience higher attrition rates, which may require further investigation into job satisfaction, opportunities for growth, or workplace conditions. On the other side, 
 Medical, Life Sciences, and "Other" fields show strong retention rates, reflecting a high level of employee satisfaction and stability.

#### Step 12 Attrition Analysis by Stock Option Level

In this step, we analyze employee attrition rates based on the Stock Option Level. First, we group the data by both the Stock Option Level and Attrition status to count the number of occurrences for each combination. Then, we calculate the percentage of employees who left (attrition) for each Stock Option Level by dividing the number of attritions by the total number of employees in each Stock Option Level. This allows us to gain insights into whether the Stock Option Level influences the likelihood of attrition. The results are displayed both in absolute terms (count) and as percentages.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3e35236-8ad0-4186-853b-0ea8d4b891e6)

the output suggests that employees with higher stock option levels tend to have a lower likelihood of attrition, 

#### Step 13 Attrition Analysis by Relationship Satisfaction

In this step, we examine the relationship between employee attrition and their Relationship Satisfaction with the company

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4844b6db-4818-479e-92d3-aa5ff212a40b)

#### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c78a1d1-7929-43ba-9c8f-f3c25dad95bb)

The analysis reveals that employees with varying levels of Relationship Satisfaction exhibit different attrition patterns. Employees with low satisfaction (level 1) show the highest attrition rate at 20.65%, while those with higher satisfaction levels (2, 3, and 4) consistently have lower attrition rates, hovering around 14-15%. This suggests that employees who are more satisfied with their relationships at work are less likely to leave, highlighting the importance of fostering positive work relationships to reduce turnover.

#### Step 14 Attrition Analysis by Job Satisfaction

In this step, we analyze employee attrition based on their Job Satisfaction levels. By examining how employees with different satisfaction levels (ranging from low to high satisfaction) relate to the likelihood of leaving the company, this analysis helps identify whether job satisfaction plays a significant role in attrition rates.

#### output

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f14d81-5027-4de6-b70f-1af6b2772d76)

This analysis reveals the relationship between Job Satisfaction and employee attrition. Employees with lower job satisfaction (Job Satisfaction level 1) exhibit a higher rate of attrition, with nearly 23% leaving the company. As job satisfaction increases, the attrition rate steadily decreases, with employees at the highest satisfaction level (Job Satisfaction level 4) showing an attrition rate of just over 11%. This trend highlights the importance of improving job satisfaction to reduce turnover, as more satisfied employees are less likely to leave the organization.
