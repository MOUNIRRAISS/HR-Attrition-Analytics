**Step 3**: Verifying the Dataset üßê

After importing the dataset, it's important to verify its structure and understand the types of data it contains. We can do this using the info() function in pandas, which provides details about the dataset, such as the number of entries, column names, data types, and the presence of missing values.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7709037-80c1-4d09-a208-b7440a32584a)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6027d574-48d0-4e16-92cc-1abb4a55460c)

This output indicates that the dataset contains ***1470*** entries with no null values across all columns, which ensures data completeness. Additionally, the data types for each column are appropriate, with int64 for numerical variables and object for categorical variables. This suggests that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, with no immediate need for data type corrections or null value handling.

**Step 4**: Checking for Duplicates üîç

In data analysis, it's crucial to check for duplicate entries, as they can skew your results. To ensure the integrity of the dataset, we use the duplicated() function to identify any duplicate rows.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23660a78-47e6-409c-bec7-cb44a708de89)

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21fec74f-d845-4ce8-93df-b5cb775d70b8)

This output  confirms that there are no duplicate rows in the dataset. This indicates that the data is unique and does not require any deduplication process, ensuring the integrity of the dataset for analysis.


##### "We have thoroughly verified the dataset, including checks for null values, duplicate rows, data types, unique identifiers, and potential inconsistencies. All aspects of the data are in good condition, with no issues requiring modification. The dataset is clean, complete, and ready for further analysis"

**Step 5**: Descriptive Statistics üìä

To better understand the dataset, I performed descriptive statistical analysis using the describe() function in pandas. This step provides a summary of the dataset's numerical columns, helping to identify key metrics like the mean, median, and standard deviation.

##### output 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a405d7-f4be-4bc5-a1f4-b5db88ae84c2)

Descriptive statistics provide a comprehensive overview of a dataset's key characteristics, allowing us to understand its structure and tendencies.

we have :

- Mean: The average value, indicating the central point.
- Standard Deviation: The variability around the mean.
- Range (Min and Max): The span from the smallest to the largest value.
- Q1 : The First Quartile The value below which ***25%*** of the data falls.
- Q2 : The Second Quartile The middle value of the dataset when sorted. It divides the data into two equal halves.
- Q3 : The Third Quartile The value below which ***75%*** of the data falls.

**Step 6** Attrition Analysis 

In this step, we analyze the Attrition column of the dataset to understand the distribution of employee attrition (whether employees left or stayed in the company).

##### Here's a visualization

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55d9c60f-1d57-4b45-9171-cb947589b59f)

**YES**: means left

**NO**: means stayed

The Attrition Count indicates that out of the total ***1470*** employees in the dataset, ***1233*** employees stayed with the company (marked as 'No'), while ***237*** employees left the company (marked as 'Yes').

The Attrition Percentage reveals that approximately ***83.88%*** of the employees stayed, while about ***16.12%*** of employees left the company. This provides a clear picture of the employee retention rate, indicating that a relatively small proportion of employees decided to leave. However, it‚Äôs essential to explore the reasons behind the attrition. By analyzing various factors and variables (such as age, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.), we can identify the key drivers of employee turnover and gain valuable insights into areas that may need attention to reduce attrition



**Step 7** Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by gender

In this step, we analyze  Distribution of gender and the relationship between employee attrition and gender to determine if there are any gender-based patterns or differences in attrition rates.

#### The results provide a gender-specific analysis of attrition:

- Female Employees:

***85.20%*** of female employees stayed with the company, indicating a high retention rate among women.

Only ***14.80%*** of female employees left the company, reflecting a relatively low attrition rate.

- Male Employees:

***82.99%*** of male employees stayed with the company, which is slightly lower than the retention rate for female employees.

***17.01%*** of male employees left the company, indicating a higher attrition rate compared to females.

These results suggest that female employees tend to have a slightly higher retention rate than male employees in the company. The reason behind this difference could be explored further by analyzing factors such as job satisfaction, work environment, or other demographic and professional attributes. Understanding these dynamics can help the company address specific issues related to male attrition and improve overall employee retention


**Step 8**: Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by Department

in this step we will explore the distribution of employees across various departments and analyze the attrition (employee turnover) rate within each department

The data shows that while Research & Development has the lowest attrition rate, Sales and Human Resources exhibit relatively higher levels of employee turnover.

**Step 9**: Analysis of Employee Distribution and Attrition by Marital Status 

In this step, we explore the marital status distribution of employees, calculating both the total number of employees in each marital status category and their corresponding percentages. Additionally, we analyze attrition rates based on marital status. By understanding the relationship between marital status and attrition, we can identify whether certain marital statuses correlate with higher or lower employee turnover. This information may help in making targeted interventions to improve retention across different employee groups.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41d2edf7-82f2-444e-802a-d130e720443f)

The distribution of marital status among employees shows that the majority are married (45.78%), followed by single employees (31.97%) and divorced employees (22.24%). This suggests that marital status is relatively balanced, with a larger portion of the workforce being married. The next step would be to analyze how attrition correlates with these marital status categories to determine if employees in certain marital statuses are more likely to leave the company.

This visualization shows the attrition distribution by marital status. Key insights from the charts:

1. ***Single Employees***: Among single employees, 25.5% have left the organization (attrition), while 74.5% have stayed. This is the highest attrition rate among the three groups.
2. ***Married Employees***: Only 12.5% of married employees have left the organization, with 87.5% staying. This indicates the lowest attrition rate.
3. ***Divorced Employees***: 10.1% of divorced employees have left, and 89.9% have stayed. This group also has a very low attrition rate, similar to married employees.¬µ

- Single employees seem to be more prone to attrition compared to married or divorced employees.
- Stability in employment appears higher among married and divorced groups. This trend could suggest that marital status influences employee retention.

**Step 10**: Attrition Analysis by Education Field

In this step, we analyze the distribution of employee attrition across different education fields.
