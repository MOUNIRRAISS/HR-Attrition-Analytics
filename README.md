### Project N°1


**Title:**  HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

**Description:**

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition to help HR teams identify key drivers of employee turnover. Using an interactive dashboard, the project visualizes critical metrics such as attrition rates by department, age group, and job role, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights.

**Technologies Used:** 

- Python for data cleaning and visualisation
- Power BI for dashboard creation.

**Data Source:**  
The data used for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

### Python - Data Cleaning & Visualization 
**Step 1**: Importing Necessary Packages

The first step in any data analysis project is to import the necessary packages or libraries. These libraries provide the functions and tools needed to manipulate the data, perform computations, and create visualizations. Below is the code I used to import the required packages for this project:

 **Step 2**: Importing the Dataset 📊
 
The next step is to import the dataset into our Python environment. This is done using the pandas library, which allows us to easily load and manipulate data. Below is the code I used to import the dataset and display the first few rows for a quick preview.

**Step 3**: Verifying the Dataset 🧐

After importing the dataset, it's important to verify its structure and understand the types of data it contains. We can do this using the info() function in pandas, which provides details about the dataset, such as the number of entries, column names, data types, and the presence of missing values.

**Step 4**: Checking for Duplicates 🔍

In data analysis, it's crucial to check for duplicate entries, as they can skew your results. To ensure the integrity of the dataset, we use the duplicated() function to identify any duplicate rows.
